Created by Stella Speziali at ECAL, Tangibles Worlds explores the effects of tactile experience as a catalyst for full immersion in VR. It proposes a “black box” interface, an alt-plysical universe to the VR experience, extending the immersion beyond visual and sound. Simultaneously, the project questions the perceptual correlation of what we perceive from the outside and the inside of VR and their mutual relationship.

“In a virtual reality experience, how to provide a more tangible VR experience? Is it possible to interact with the virtual universe in some other way rather than only employing (handling) the controllers provided?” –– Stella Speziali

Tangibles Worlds is an experiment that seeks to combine virtual reality, which is immaterial and digital, with touch, which is the sense that allows us to get closer to things. Stella’s project aims to make sure that the user doesn’t limit himself/herself by simply observing the virtual universe, but to interact with the material within and become attentive of the feedback through his sensations and feelings that come through tactile experience.
