Sensorium is a festival with conference, workshops & showcase bridging the fields of computational art, design and performance.
</div>
It is the genre-defining platform to **experience possible futures of the creative industry on the crossover of art, design and technology**.
Immerse yourself in the world of dynamic and interactive installations, AI, graphics, data visualisations, generative architecture, design and virtual reality. Internationally established artists and designers who use computation as a creative practice will get together in Bratislava to discuss their projects, processes and ideas. Sensorium is a first-of-its-kind educational event in Slovakia on the crossover of art, design and technology.

Since it’s beginning, Sensorium has been collaborating with [Resonate](http://resonate.io) festival, whose co-founder Eduard Prats Molner is regularly co-curating Sensorium's programme. The festival also collaborates with international organisations such as [TodaysArt](http://todaysart.nl) in the Netherlands. Since this year, London-based creative producer and curator [Carmen Salas](http://carmensp.com/) is a consulting advisor.

We believe the program will amaze you. Sensorium invites ground-breaking works of art employing cutting-edge technology, but mainly the opportunity to meet and connect with innovative artists and designers. The aim of the event is to give creators a space to present their work and through that to stir a forward-thinking debate of ideas, opinions and visions connecting technology and art.

<h3 id="theme">Homo Arbiter Formae</h3>

Throughout this year’s conference, we will examine contemporary innovation in creative practice in the wider context of the changing role of ‘the creator’. Building on Jack Burnham’s 1968 essay ['System Aesthetics'](https://www.are.na/block/2081303), we will investigate the shift from “Homo Faber” (Man the Maker) to **“Homo Arbiter Formae”** (Man the Maker of Aesthetic Decisions). 

This is a shift away from the materiality of the conventional art object and the direct control of the creator making that object. A shift towards conceptuality and a more distanced stance towards the object itself, allowing for focus on the systems and processes that bring forth the work.

What is lost in this shift? What is gained? <br>
We look forward to explore this theme together with you!

#### Exploring Sensorium's system aesthetics

We invite you to explore the system behind the animations you see running on the [home page background](/#about) and make your own aesthetic decisions using the black sliders on the page. 

These animations are created by [bit101 (Keith Peters)](http://www.bit-101.com/) and we are grateful that he's given us the oportunity to build on his open-source work. Check out his [BIT-101 Lab](https://bit101.github.io/lab/thumbs.html), which has an amazing collection of daily sketches built using HTML5 Canvas.
