Sensorium Festival is workshops, talks and performances bridging the fields of computational art, design and performance.
</div>

Sensorium is the genre-defining platform to **experience possible futures of the creative industry on the crossover of art, design and technology**. It brings together a community of internationally renowned creative minds to inspire multidisciplinary creative practice through discussion and showcasing of ground-breaking work. The festival aims to contribute to filling the educational gap in the field of creative technology in Slovakia and the wider Central European area.

The programme has two main parts: **conference** and **showcase**. The conference invites international speakers from multidisciplinary fields to present their ideas and research. It aims to gather a niche community of professionals in the field. An integral part in the run up to the conference is a series of workshops, giving participants hands-on experience with the creative application of emerging technology. The showcase programme presents extraordinary audio-visual performances and installations.

The festival is focussed on **emerging practices in computational art, design and performance**. Common themes are artificial intelligence, generative design, architecture, networked society, virtual reality, IoT, embodiment, experimental music and performance, sensors and wearables.

Since it’s beginning, Sensorium has been collaborating with [Resonate](http://resonate.io) festival, whose co-founder Eduard Prats Molner is one of Sensorium's regular programme curators. The festival also collaborates with international organisations such as [TodaysArt](http://todaysart.nl) in the Netherlands. Since this year, London-based creative producer and curator [Carmen Salas](http://carmensp.com/) is a consulting advisor.

We can’t wait to see you 4-5 May 2018!
