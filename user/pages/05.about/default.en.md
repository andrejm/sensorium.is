Sensorium is a festival with conference, workshops & showcase bridging the fields of computational art, design and performance.
</div>
It is the genre-defining platform to **experience possible futures of the creative industry on the crossover of art, design and technology**.
Immerse yourself in the world of dynamic and interactive installations, AI, graphics, data visualisations, generative architecture, design and virtual reality. Internationally established artists and designers who use computation as a creative practice will get together in Bratislava to discuss their projects, processes and ideas. Sensorium is a first-of-its-kind educational event in Slovakia on the crossover of art, design and technology.

Since it’s beginning, Sensorium has been collaborating with [Resonate](http://resonate.io) festival, whose co-founder Eduard Prats Molner is regularly co-curating Sensorium's programme. The festival also collaborates with international organisations such as [TodaysArt](http://todaysart.nl) in the Netherlands. Since this year, London-based creative producer and curator [Carmen Salas](http://carmensp.com/) is a consulting advisor.

We believe the program will amaze you. Sensorium invites ground-breaking works of art employing cutting-edge technology, but mainly the opportunity to meet and connect with innovative artists and designers. The aim of the event is to give creators a space to present their work and through that to stir a forward-thinking debate of ideas, opinions and visions connecting technology and art.

## Sensorium 2018 Theme
This year's conference theme 'Homo Arbiter Formae' (Latin for 'Man the maker of aesthetic decisions', after Jack Burnham's 1968 System Aesthetics).

Through this theme, we'd like to address the shifting role of creators from 'Man the maker' to 'Man the maker of aesthetic decisions'. We recognize this progression - which Burnham traces back to the start of the industrial revolution - in the speakers' work in several ways:

*     a more distanced relationship between the creator and their work (or part of their work process), in the sense that creators often work on tools or frameworks which in turn produce/render/generate the work.
*     a changing role of the creator, which becomes more akin to 'system thinker' as they are more involved with defining a system of rules, procedures and parameters that can be bring forth instantiations of the work.
*     in the work of this year's speakers (and many of the previous ones) we see traces of an aesthetic that seems to embody this changing relation.

We can’t wait to see you!
