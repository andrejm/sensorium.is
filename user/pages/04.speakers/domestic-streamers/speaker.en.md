Driven by data, guided by stories
Domestic Data Streamers was founded in 2013 with the goal of creating new ways of communicating through data storytelling.

They bring people closer to data beyond any language and cultural differences. Thatâ€™s why they use design, art, science and technology and have such a diversity of disciplines within the team, from anthropologists and psychologists to engineers and designers, from Barcelona, to Hong Kong to US.

They know that the essential ingredients for Their work are perseverance, diversity, smart people and passion.
