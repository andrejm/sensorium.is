Mario Klingemann is an artist working with algorithms and data. He is particularly focussed on using artificial intelligence as an artistic tool and a stepping stone for building autonomous creative machines. An important part of his investigations is his work with digital cultural archives like the British Library or the Google Cultural Institute where he is currently artist in residence.

He is a regular speaker on international art, design and media conferences, winner of the 2015 creative award of the British Library and his works have been shown at the Residenzschlo√ü Dresden, the Centre Pompidou, Paris and the MoMA, New York.
