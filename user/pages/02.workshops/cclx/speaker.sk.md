**Tuesday 1 May 2018 - Friday 4 May 2018**

**Limited number of participants.**
**[Register here](https://goo.gl/forms/U0FOeCKNIgMKWZBq1)** Submissions deadline is on 15th of March.

Are you an artist working creatively with digital media and/or code and you are interested in movement or contemporary dance? Then come join the next Choreographic Coding Lab hosted by Sensorium Festival and artists Mária Júdová and Toby K Bratislava on May 1sth -4th, 2018.
Coding skills are NOT a requirement to participate but you need to have basic awareness in the area of digital media.

**Choreographic Coding Lab (CCLx)**

...is an internationally traveling format offering digital media ‘code savvy’ artists the opportunity to translate aspects of choreography and dance into digital form and apply choreographic thinking to their own practice. In a one week interdisciplinary peer-to-peer setting, the participants work on their own projects, share knowledge, find new collaboration partners, discuss ideas and challenges. Previous CCLs have been joined by digital artists, musicians, architects, physicists and dancers, all bringing along a variety of emerging new media tools and setups that can be experimented with and explored for new artistic ideas. Results from the week might range from prototypes for artworks to new plug-ins for working with dance related datasets ([see a selection of projects here](http://choreographiccoding.org/#projects)). CCLs finally seek to initiate a sustainable collaborative practice among its participants encouraging ongoing exchange in an artistic research community of individuals.

CCLs were originally an outcome of Motion Bank, a four-year research project of The Forsythe Company focused on the creation of on line digital scores with guest choreographers.
CCLx Bratislava is an independent edition of Choreographic Coding Lab. This edition will be facilitated by Mária Júdová and Toby K, supported by Motion Bank and presented by Sensorium Festival.

**Contributions and Working Process**
This CCL will be one of a series of workshops that happen in the framework of **Sensorium festival** and that will allow for opportunities of high-level expert exchange. During the lab, everyone will work on their ideas, exchange and discuss new ideas.
The Choreographic Coding Lab will take place at the [Pisztory Palace](https://www.google.sk/maps/place/Pisztoryho+%C4%BEav%C3%A9+kr%C3%ADdlo/@48.1522464,17.1043399,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x476c8950a54a98d5:0x707fc460f1006699!8m2!3d48.1522428!4d17.1065286?hl=en) in **Bratislava, Slovakia**.
The lab will consist of a 4 day workshop. During the workshop both formal and informal learning sessions will happen on a range of technical, choreographic and conceptual topics. Participants are encouraged to bring existing projects, sensors and interfaces they want to work with and share with their peers, and are encouraged to propose their own sessions if they would like to get feedback on their projects or discuss a technique. Through the lab experimentation with new techniques, technologies and conceptual challenges help artists push their practice. We hope to foster new collaborations amongst the participants. 
The CCL will result in an **open lab session on its last day 4th of May in Pisztory Palace, Bratislava**. Experts and the interested public will be invited to look behind the scenes, test prototypes and ask questions.

**Apply and Join CCL Bratislava!**
We are looking for diverse participants with a range of practices across choreographic and technical fields. We are looking for both emerging and experienced artists. Collaborative teams involving coders, choreographers, object, sound and filmmakers interested in the Motion Bank research approach are very much encouraged to apply. Participation in the CCL is free, but a selection will be made to ensure the right balance of participants and what they bring to the lab including specialized software and hardware for working with movement data. The space and basic equipment (projectors and cables) will be provided, any specific equipment needs to be carried by the participants. We have a quick and easy application process that's only open for two weeks, so [apply today](https://goo.gl/forms/U0FOeCKNIgMKWZBq1)! **Applications close on Thursday 15th March.**

The CCL Bratislava is supported by **[Goethe Institut Bratislava](http://www.goethe.de/ins/sk/bra)**.
