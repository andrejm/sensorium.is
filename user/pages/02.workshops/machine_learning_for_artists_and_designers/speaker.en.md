Gene Kogan will run us through the theory and techniques of machine learning applied to creative practices.  It will focus on core algorithms used for parsing, visualizing, and discovering patterns in complex multimedia data, including images, sounds, and text. A broad range of applications of interest to graphic artists, game designers, filmmakers, and sound designers will also be surveyed. 

Detailed description of the workshop will be provided soon.
For now you can read this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@genekogan/machine-learning-for-artists-e93d20fdb097#.4v6qhs1bh) from Gene Kogan on teaching Machine learning for artists.
