Time: 10.30 - 17.30


Curious about enabling machines to gain human-like capabilities? Would you like to know how to teach your computer recognise environment around itself? Gene Kogan will introduce you to these techniques in the context of art and design during an all day workshop: Machine learning for artists and designers on the 30th April in Bratislava. No need of previous coding experience. Limited amount of participants.

Gene Kogan will introduce the theory and application of machine learning for creative and artistic practice. It will focus on core algorithms used for parsing, visualizing, and discovering patterns in complex multimedia data, including images, sounds, and text. We will learn how to use neural networks to create real-time, cross-modal interactions for use in video and installation, as well as live music performance. We will also provide tools and code for clustering and visualizing large collections of multimedia. Prior coding experience in a text-based (Python, Java, C++) or patch-based (Max/MSP) programming environment is helpful but not necessary.

This workshop is suitable for BEGINNERS, NO NEED OF previous EXPERIENCE with machine learning or programming! If you have experience you can still join the workshop and you will be able to get deeper into the problematics.

For now you can read this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@genekogan/machine-learning-for-artists-e93d20fdb097#.4v6qhs1bh) from Gene Kogan on teaching Machine learning for artists.
