title: 'Computer vision workshop'
---

In this two day workshop we'll begin from the beginning learning how to
help machines see and understand the world around them. We'll look at
several different techniques to help computers see from using facial
recognition, being able to read using optical character recognition, and
finding objects using different object recognition techniques. This
workshop is open to beginners and we'll be using the Processing programming
environment to create our applications, though the techniques we'll discuss
can be used in Python or C++ as well.

You should bring a laptop with a camera and with Processing installed and
working and the Video library installed and working (run a few of the
examples beforehand to make sure that they work). Processing can be
downloaded from http://processing.org and the video library from
https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html
