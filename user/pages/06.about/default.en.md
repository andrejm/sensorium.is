Sensorium is a festival with conference, workshops & showcase bridging the fields of computational art, design and performance.
</div>
It is the genre-defining platform to **experience possible futures of the creative industry on the crossover of art, design and technology**.
Immerse yourself in the world of dynamic and interactive installations, AI, graphics, data visualisations, generative architecture, design and virtual reality. Internationally established artists and designers who use computation as a creative practice will get together in Bratislava to discuss their projects, processes and ideas. Sensorium is a first-of-its-kind educational event in Slovakia on the crossover of art, design and technology.

Since it’s beginning, Sensorium has been collaborating with [Resonate](http://resonate.io) festival, whose co-founder Eduard Prats Molner is regularly co-curating Sensorium's programme. The festival also collaborates with international organisations such as [TodaysArt](http://todaysart.nl) in the Netherlands. Since this year, London-based creative producer and curator [Carmen Salas](http://carmensp.com/) is a consulting advisor.

We believe the program will amaze you. Sensorium invites ground-breaking works of art employing cutting-edge technology, but mainly the opportunity to meet and connect with innovative artists and designers. The aim of the event is to give creators a space to present their work and through that to stir a forward-thinking debate of ideas, opinions and visions connecting technology and art.

We can’t wait to see you!
