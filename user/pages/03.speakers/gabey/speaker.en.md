**Gabey Tjon a Tham is an installation artist working and living in the Hague, The Netherlands. She transforms spaces into sensory and immersive environments through kinetic machines, light, and sound.**

Gabey observes behaviours in nature from where she extracts and assembles underlying structures. Technology is a natural occurrence for Tjon a Tham: â€œWhile what we have traditionally called nature is increasingly being influenced by human action, our technological environment is becoming increasingly complex and untameable, we almost have to relate to it as a new nature.

In her works the technology has a logic on its own, it conflicts and harmonizes. The artist develops techniques and invents mechanical sculptures that embed different materials and perform at different poetic levels. Hereby natural-mechanical choreographies arise. The works invite us to wonder at, contemplate, and investigate.
