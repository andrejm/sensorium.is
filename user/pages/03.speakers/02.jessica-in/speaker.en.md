**Jessica is an architect, designer, creative coder + educator, teaching at the [Bartlett Interactive Architecture Lab](http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/). Her architectural specialisations and interests lie in computation, interaction and fabrication methodologies for Architecture, with a particular emphasis on the expressive potential of technology as a means to explore bespoke design.**


She is currently pursuing her interests in drawing and robotics and for interactive design explorations, having recently delivered the programming for Ruairi Glynn’s Fearful Symmetry installation at the Itau Cultural gallery in Sao Paulo.  She is particularly interested in physically embodied interaction that explores semantic and relational conditions between im-material / virtual-physical space. Her current work is specifically focused on drawing, machine learning and robotics, however she also enjoys creating virtual environments for string puppets, as well as making industrial robots to dance with light.


A Teaching Fellow at the Bartlett School of Architecture, she runs BSc Unit 9 with Chee-Kit Lai, and is also part of the MArch Design for Performance + Interaction teaching team for the Interactive Architecture Lab with Ruairi Glynn. Prior to joining the Bartlett she was a Designer at Heatherwick Studio, responsible for the Project Coordination and Production of the Google Campus in Mountain View and the Hudson Yards Vessel sculpture projects.

Jessica will be exploring this year's theme ['Homo Arbiter Formae'](/about/#theme) in a panel discussion with [Ján Šicko](/speakers/jan-sicko) and [Joshua Noble](/speakers/joshua-noble), moderated by  [Alexander Scholz](/speakers/alexander-scholz).
