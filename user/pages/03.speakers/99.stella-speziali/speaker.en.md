Stella Speziali is a multidisciplinary Interactive Designer living in Zürich. After graduating from ECAL - Ecole cantonale d'art de Lausanne she decided to pursue her studies with a Master in Interaction Design at ZHDK - Zürcher Hochschule der Künste. Since 2015 she is interested in immersive experiences where she explores the spatial experience, manipulating the perception and the relationship between touch, sound, light and space.

Stella will exhibit her piece Tangibles Worlds. It is an experiment that offers an experience of sensory immersion. The combination of visual, sound and touch leads the user beyond a simple observation, but create the feeling of a full immersion in a parallel universe. In a virtual reality experience, how to provide a more tangible VR experience? Is it possible to interact with the virtual universe in some other way rather than only employing (handling) the controllers provided?
