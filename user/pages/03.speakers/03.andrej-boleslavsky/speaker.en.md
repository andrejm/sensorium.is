Andrej Boleslavský (SK/CZ) is an independent digital artist purposing technology in the fields of new media art, virtual reality, light installations and physical computing. His work also maintains a strong fascination with the entanglement of nature and technology. In his collaborative works with digital artist Mária Júdová he explores the boundary between physical and digital. He has developed many interactive installations and lectured on open source and creative coding tools. In addition to his work he is actively involved as a technologist for other artists and interaction designers.

In his presentation Andrej Boleslavský will present aspects of physicality in the context of virtual reality and dance. Throughout the last few years, his collaborative works alongside with digital artist Mária Júdová take inspiration from contemporary dance and digital technologies. By creating interactions between this two seemingly contradicting media they aim to create confusing yet artistically meaningful experiences. During the talk we will go behind the scenes of the award winning VR installation Dust, mixed reality game Camouflage and the recent dance and VR piece Unlit Horizon.
