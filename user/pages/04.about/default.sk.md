Sensorium is two days of workshops and talks bridging the fields of computational art, design and performance.
</div>

Immerse yourself in the world of dynamic and interactive installations, graphics, data visualisations and generative design. Internationally established artists and designers who use computation as a creative practice will get together in Bratislava to discuss their projects, processes and ideas. Sensorium is a first-of-its-kind educational event in Slovakia on the crossover of art, design and technology.

Since it’s beginning, Sensorium has been collaborating with Resonate festival, whose co-founder Eduard Prats Molner is one of Sensorium's programme curators this year.

We believe the program will amaze you. Sensorium invites ground-breaking works of art employing cutting-edge technology, but mainly the opportunity to meet and connect with innovative artists and designers. The aim of the event is to give creators a space to present their work and through that to stir a forward-thinking debate of ideas, opinions and visions connecting technology and art.

We can’t wait to see you!
