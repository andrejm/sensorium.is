**This workshop is designed for anyone interested in learning about how machines can see and learn about the world around them. We'll cover very basic techniques for seeing colors and tracking objects all the way to complex machine vision techniques for detecting objects and classifying them.** 


The workshop will also explore how computer vision is used to create augmented and mixed reality, object recognition, and understanding image context. We'll also discuss specific kinds of cameras and strategies for working with computer vision in making art, creating videos and film, in building intelligent spaces, and in working with robotics. 


You should bring a laptop with a camera and with Processing installed and working and the Video library installed and working (run a few of the examples beforehand to make sure that they work). Processing can be downloaded from [http://processing.org](http://processing.org) and the video library from [here](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html).
